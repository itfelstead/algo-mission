Algorithm mission: Basically a bit like a web version of BigTrak/BeeBot.

In many UK primary schools BigTrak has made a comeback in the form of BeeBot.
Devices like these follow simple directional instructions which in theory provide kids with an introductory experience of algorithms and the associated joys of working with machines that do what they're told rather than what you want.

This project aims to create a three.js based path programmable object much like the BigTrak/BeeBot.
